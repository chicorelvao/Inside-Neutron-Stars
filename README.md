# Inside-Neutron-Stars
My first intership about the inside properties of neutron stars

My first internship was about manipulating theorical data obtained from models applied to measaured propretires of neutron stars. I learned to work in University envoiroment with professors and colegues. I worked on very old codes written in fortran and developed scripts in bash and python to present the data in a meanignfull way. Me and my group made and publish an poster to present our job to the local departement of physics.
